# TakeNote

  ## Description
  A simple yet effective note taking application.

  ## Installation
  Run `npm i` in the project terminal. Followed by `npm install express --save`. And finally run `node server.js` to deploy it to http://localhost:3000.

  ## Usage
  At the start you'll be presented with the main index.html presenting the application. Click the `Get Started` button to begin. You'll be taken to the second page, notes.html which presents you a field to enter both a title and text. Afterwhich you can save and that data will be presented as a new note, saved to the left side of the page. The trashcan icon and functionality therein provides you the option to delete notes as needed.
